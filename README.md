# Mandatory 2: Courses

The goal of this project is to create a web application for a school, where you can create courses, and assign teachers and students to these. 

## Getting Started

To download the program files, you will need to follow this link:

https://github.com/ortismal/3-semester-computer-science/

On the page to the top right you will see a green button saying 'clone or download'. Choose 'download ZIP', and when the folder is downloaded, extract the files to a location of your choice.
Once you have extracted the file, open up your IDE (we have used IntelliJ), and open the folder Mandatory2_FSS. Once the project is opened, you run the program and go to localhost:8080/courses

### Prerequisites

What you need to have to run this program:

1. IntelliJ IDEA (or any other IDE that supports Java and Spring).
2. MySQL Workbench.
3. A web browser.
4. Internet connection (because the database is on an online server)
